Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB, Mongoose

Job Scheduling: Agenda.js

Development Tools: dotenv, nodemon

API Testing: Postman, Insomnia (Recommended)

Project Structure
The project follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern (though "View" is conceptual for an API) to ensure a clear separation of concerns:

(For more detailed examples, please refer to the code or test with an API client.)

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14.x or later recommended)

npm (usually comes with Node.js)

MongoDB (Ensure it's running locally or you have access to a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)

Installation & Setup
1. Clone Repository
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inkmind-api.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inkmind-api.git)
cd inkmind-api

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project directory. You can copy the contents of .env.example (if you create one) or create it from scratch.

.env file content:

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development # or production

# MongoDB Connection
# For local MongoDB:
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/inkmindDB"
# For MongoDB Atlas (replace with your actual connection string):
# MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/inkmindDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# Agenda.js (uses the same MONGO_URI by default if not specified separately in agenda config)
# You can also set a specific collection name for Agenda jobs in services/agenda/scheduler.js

# Optional: JWT Secret for authentication (if you implement it later)
# JWT_SECRET="your_very_strong_secret_key_here"

Important:

Replace placeholder values (especially MONGO_URI) with your actual configuration.

Ensure your MongoDB server is running.

Running the Application
Development Mode
This mode uses nodemon for automatic server restarts when files change.

npm run dev

The API will typically be available at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your .env file). You will see log messages in the console indicating the server has started and connected to the database and Agenda.

Production Mode (Simulated)
This command starts the server using node directly.

npm start

Testing the API
Use an API client like Postman or Insomnia to interact with the API endpoints.

Key Test Scenarios:

CRUD Operations: Create, retrieve, update, and delete notes.

Archiving/Restoring: Archive a note, verify it's hidden from default GET /notes, retrieve it via ?archived=true, and then restore it.

Pinning/Unpinning: Pin a note, verify it appears at the top of the default GET /notes list, and then unpin it.

Reminders:

Create a note with a reminderAt set a few minutes in the future (use UTC ISO 8601 format, e.g., YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).

Observe the server console for logs indicating the job was scheduled by Agenda.

After the reminder time passes (plus Agenda's processEvery interval, e.g., 30 seconds), check the console for the reminder handler logs.

Test updating a reminder time (should cancel the old job and schedule a new one).

Test clearing a reminder by setting reminderAt: null (should cancel the job).

Test deleting/archiving a note with an active reminder (should cancel the job).

Filtering & Sorting: Test the various query parameters for GET /notes.

Agenda.js Scheduler for Reminders
This API uses Agenda.js to manage and process note reminders in the background.

Scheduling: When a note is created or updated with a reminderAt date in the future, a job is scheduled with Agenda. Any existing reminder for that note is cancelled first to avoid duplicates.

Job Definition: A single job type (sendInkMindNoteReminderJob) is defined in services/agenda/scheduler.js.

Processing: The sendInkMindNoteReminder handler function in services/agenda/handler.js is executed when a scheduled reminder time is reached. Currently, this handler logs the reminder details to the console. In a full application, this handler would trigger actual notifications (e.g., email, push notification).

Cancellation: Reminders are automatically cancelled if the note is deleted, archived, or if the reminderAt field is cleared or updated.

Configuration: Agenda connects to MongoDB (using the same MONGO_URI or a specific one) and stores its job queue in a dedicated collection (e.g., inkMindAgendaJobs). It polls the database at intervals defined by processEvery in its configuration.

Future Enhancements (Ideas)
User Authentication & Authorization: Implement JWT-based authentication so notes belong to specific users.

Full-Text Search: Integrate more advanced search capabilities across note titles and content.

Tags/Labels: Allow users to add multiple tags to notes for better organization.

Rich Text/Markdown Support: Allow notes to be formatted.

Actual Notification System: Integrate email (Nodemailer, SendGrid) or push notifications (FCM) for reminders.

API Rate Limiting & Security Hardening: Implement helmet, express-rate-limit, etc.

Comprehensive API Documentation: Generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

Unit & Integration Tests: Add a robust testing suite.
